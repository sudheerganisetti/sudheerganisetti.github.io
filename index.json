I obtained my master’s degree in physics with a specialization in condensed matter physics from Pondicherry University. However, I felt that the time frame during the thesis did not allow me to explore more of the topic. The desire made me move to Ruhr University Bochum for my second master’s program in materials science and simulations. At Bochum, I had the opportunity to work on problems that originated at different length scales (from atomistic to continuum scale) in various materials. With a solid foundation in the basics of materials science, I have registered for a doctoral degree at the University of Erlangen, and I am currently pursuing my PhD. As part of my doctoral thesis, I have been working on glass simulations. I have been a co-author for a scientific software called IMD to perform molecular dynamics simulations. Also, I have developed several codes in python, C, C++, BASH, AWK, etc., to compute various structural, dynamical, transport, and mechanical properties of glasses by analyzing the datasets obtained with quantum and classical molecular dynamics simulations.

The role of the incorporated fluoride and its distribution within the glass were interpreted and analyzed using Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results were compared with the modified random network (MRN) model. The interpretations from the model have been verified using the MAS-NMR spectroscopy technique. According to this model, fluoride containing bioactive glasses have been proposed to consist of silicate rich network regions and modifier cation – fluoride rich inter-network regions. The interface region was found to consist of non-bridging oxygen species (NBO) and phosphate cations which are either isolated orthophosphates (Q0P) or bridged with silicates in the form of pyrophosphate (Q1P) units forming Si–O–P bonds. The gradual substitution of CaF2 for CaO in the base glass resulted in an increase in the silicate network connectivity with a reduction in the NBOs and lead to an increase in the association of modifier cations with fluoride ions. However, fluoride ions were found to show a marginal preference to associate with Na+ cations leading to a decrease in the association of Na+ ions with orthophosphate and silicate units. These overall structural findings were correlated with the in vitro ion dissolution behaviour of the bioactive glasses as well as with the thermal properties. The glasses were tested for their in vitro cell viability towards mouse osteoblast type (MC3T3) cells in which fluoride containing bioactive glasses did not show any toxicity and exhibited better cell proliferation. The antibacterial efficacy of the fluoride containing glasses was tested at various concentrations (5, 10 and 20 mg/ml) in E.coli bacterial inoculum in which bactericidal action was evidenced.","tags":null,"title":"Elucidating the effect of CaF2 on structure, biocompatibility and antibacterial properties of S53P4 glass","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sudheer Ganisetti","Anuraag Gaddam","Rajesh Kumar","Sathravada Balaji","Glenn C.

Evidence for the formation of Al–O–Al and Al–NBO bonds in the glass composition 38.7CaO–9.7MgO–12.9Al2O3–38.7SiO2 (CMAS, mol%) has been provided based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Analyses in the short-range order confirm that silicon and the majority of aluminium cations form regular tetrahedra. Well-separated homonuclear (Si–O–Si) and heteronuclear (Si–O–Al) cluster regions have been identified. In addition, a channel region (C-Region), separated from the network region, enriched with both NBO and non-framework modifier cations, has also been identified. These findings are in support of the previously proposed extended modified random network (EMRN) model for aluminosilicate glasses. A detailed analysis of the structural distributions revealed that a majority of Al, 51.6%, is found in Si–O–Al links. Although the formation of Al–O–Al and Al–NBO bonds is energetically less favourable, a significant amount of Al is found in Al–O–Al links (33.5%), violating Lowenstein's rule, and the remainder is bonded with non-bridging oxygen (NBO) in the form of Al–NBO (Al–O–(Ca, Mg)). The conditions necessary for the formation of less favourable bonds are attributed to the presence of a high amount of modifier cations in current CMAS glass and their preferable coordination.","tags":null,"title":"Elucidating the formation of Al–NBO bonds, Al–O–Al linkages and clusters in alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glasses based on molecular dynamics simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amarnath R.

The current paper shows that breaching of the Al-avoidance principle is essential for understanding the distribution of network-forming AlO4 and SiO4 structural units in alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glasses. The present study proposes a new modified random network (NMRN) model, which accepts Al–O–Al linkages for aluminosilicate glasses. The NMRN model consists of two regions, a network structure region (NS-Region) composed of well-separated homonuclear and heteronuclear framework species and a channel region (C-Region) of nonbridging oxygens (NBOs) and nonframework cations. The NMRN model accounts for the structural changes and devitrification behavior of aluminosilicate glasses. A parent Ca- and Al-rich melilite-based CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 (CMAS) glass composition was modified by substituting MgO for CaO and SiO2 for Al2O3 to understand variations in the distribution of network-forming structural units in the NS-region and devitrification behavior upon heat treating. The structural features of the glass and glass–ceramics (GCs) were meticulously assessed by advanced characterization techniques including neutron diffraction (ND), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), 29Si and 27Al magic angle spinning (MAS)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and in situ Raman spectroscopy. ND revealed the formation of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedral units in all the glass compositions. Simulations of chemical glass compositions based on deconvolution of 29Si MAS NMR spectral analysis indicate the preferred formation of Si–O–Al over Si–O–Si and Al–O–Al linkages and the presence of a high concentration of nonbridging oxygens leading to the formation of a separate NS-region containing both SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra (Si/Al) (heteronuclear) in addition to the presence of Al[4]–O–Al[4] bonds; this region coexists with a predominantly SiO4-containing (homonuclear) NS-region. In GCs, obtained after heat treatment at 850 °C for 250 h, the formation of crystalline phases, as revealed from Rietveld refinement of XRD data, may be understood on the basis of the distribution of SiO4 and AlO4 structural units in the NS-region. The in situ Raman spectra of the GCs confirmed the formation of a Si/Al structural region, as well as indicating interaction between the Al/Si region and SiO4-rich region at higher temperatures, leading to the formation of additional crystalline phases.","tags":null,"title":"Structure and Crystallization of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glasses: Prevention of the Alumina-Avoidance Principle","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Multiscale Modelling of the Influence of Oxygen on Structure and Cohesion of \u0026Sigma;5 Symmetrical Tilt Grain Boundary in Molybdenum  The brittle fracture of real materials originates from the atomistic mechanisms like sequential bond breaking, which leads to the crack initiation, propagation and finally to material damage in the macro scale. Predicting such material failures, and there by analyzing mechanical properties are challenging as well as complex tasks. To achieve these challenges, it often require the knowledge from atomic level to macroscopic level, therefore, scale bridging of different length scales is necessary. In this work, we have investigated how the oxygen and carbon impurities influence fracture behavior when segregated to the ∑5 symmetrical tilt grain boundary in molybdenum. Mechanical properties such as work of separation and theoretical strength were computed based on the calculations performed at different length scales, i.e, from atomistic length scales to macroscopic length scales. Ab-initio method based on density functional theory were used for the atomistic scale calculations, and finite element method based on cohesive traction separation laws were used for the continuum scale calculations.\nThe key idea to this approach is the recasting of the atomistic results within the frame work of a continuum cohesive zone model. The traction separation laws were derived by performing the tensile tests using the first principle calculations. The effective cohesive zone elements were then defined, and placed along all the possible fracture interfaces in a finite element mesh. Finite element simulations were then used to study the failure properties at the macroscopic length scales.\nDensity functional theory based total energy and electronic structure calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The electron exchange and correlation interactions were approximated by the generalized gradient approximation, and electron ion interactions were treated with the ultrasoft pseudo potentials for 80 atom supercell. The grain boundary energy, work of separation, and theoretical strengths were calculated for various oxygen impurity concentrations, i.e, from 0 to 4 oxygen atoms per grain boundary. It was found that oxygen shows an embrittling effect in the molybdenum grain boundary, see the above figure. However, when carbon is placed along with oxygen, the embrittling effect of the oxygen was compensated partially by the carbon atoms.\n","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343779200,"objectID":"e0dc35ff4d12009163c3d86bf6a461d5","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/01_multiscale_modelling/","publishdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/01_multiscale_modelling/","section":"project","summary":"Multiscale Modelling of the influence of Oxygen ...","tags":["dft","fem"],"title":"Multiscale Modelling","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Building of Bridges using Phase Field Method  In civil engineering, shape optimization is necessary to build strong structures according to their structural performances. Most structural optimizations take into account structural performances such as stress, mass, deformation. In this work, we have partially optimized the shape of a bridge which connects two banks of a river. To build the strong bridge to withstand high mechanical loads, we have used the technique of growing high strength material in the place of high stress areas, and filled the remaining place with a soft and low weight material such as ‘air’. The ‘growth’ of the high strength material in high stress fields has done based on the Phase Field method. The key idea used is the replacement of actual shape optimization problem by a two phase material distribution problem. The two materials used are the high contrast in their strength properties, a matrix material and a high strength material in the form of inclusions. Phase field method was used to find the motion of optimized shape boundaries. To solve the multicomponent phase field equations, an open source library called ‘OpenPhase’ developed at Prof. Ingo Steinbach department, ICAMS, has been used. The above figure shows: (a) Initialization of different areas of a bridge with different phases, (b) A partially optimized arc shape of the bridge (every pole has the same eigenstrain)\nA C++ code has been written to initialize the model with different phases representing different material properties in the OpenPhase source code. The driving force is assigned to the inclusion material in such a way that it grows in the region where the stresses are high. From the results, we observed that the shape of the optimized structure looks like a semicircle arc shape. Here, we have not taken the idle values of the input parameters for the surrounding environments like water and air etc., so the arc shape is not fully formed. Some more work has to be done to complete the arc shape bridge. However, based on the primary results, we have showcased that the structures can be optimized with Phase Fields using the OpenPhase code.\n","date":1333238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333238400,"objectID":"313f991281e4e918f3a064d2282f5fe6","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/02_phase_field/","publishdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/02_phase_field/","section":"project","summary":"Building of Bridges using Phase Field Method","tags":["phase"],"title":"Phase Field","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Diffusion of Carbon in High Silicon Steel  Many important phenomena in materials science involve diffusion of impurities. It is well known that diffusion of carbon in metals typically occurs via an interstitial mechanism, which can be strongly affected by the presence of other alloying elements. The interstitial diffusion of carbon controls the phase transformation in steel and therefore the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties. Density functional theory (DFT) based total energy and electronic structure calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to understand how silicon affects the the diffusion path of carbon in steel. The electron exchange and correlation interactions were approximated by the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), and electron ion interactions were treated with Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) potentials. Through this work, we have studied two cases. In the first case, the energy barriers of one octahedral site to another octahedral site in the diffusion path of carbon atom away from the silicon atom in bcc Fe were computed, and these values were compared with the energy barriers of the pure bcc Fe system. In the second case, we have studied the possibilities of diffusion paths of C from octahedral position of one of the faces of a unit cell to the octahedral site of the neighboring face of the same unit cell. Fig (a) shows a supercell consisting of two unit cells. Silicon is substitutionally added to the body centred atom of the first unitcell, and carbon diffuses away from the silicon atom through interstitial positions 1_Oct, 2_Tetra, 3_Oc, etc., as shown in the fig (a). The fig (b) shows the total relaxed energy of the system of 53 Fe atoms with one substitutionally added Si and one interstitial C atom along the diffusing path of C from 1st octahedral site to the 7th Octahedral site away from the Si. After finding the formation energies and energy barriers, we conclude that the silicon traps the carbon atom to its second nearest neighbor tetrahedral position or third nearest neighbor octahedral position. It was also revealed that the diffusion path of C from Octahedral site of one face to the octahedral site of the neighboring face is possible only through the tetrahedral interstitial site even in the presence of Si.\n","date":1305417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1305417600,"objectID":"9f9a9d5991dee0638f4d22c22e3c356d","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/03_diffusion_of_carbon/","publishdate":"2011-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/03_diffusion_of_carbon/","section":"project","summary":"Diffusion of Carbon in High Silicon Steel","tags":["dft"],"title":"DFT","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Monte Carlo method was used to tackle the global optimization problem of molecular structure. A Fortran code was developed to optimize a 13 atom molecular structure. Molecular simulations are very convenient to get insight into the structure and thermal behavior of small atomic clusters. Atomic structures are finite size aggregates containing between a few and millions of particles. Due to their small dimensions, their theoretical study faces serious difficulties. The most properties exhibit a strong dependence on the number of atoms. These difficulties actually begin with the unoptimized structure, from which other characteristics will develop. Predicting the temperature where the cluster changes phase also requires simulations. By the use of numerical simulation method, we can achieve phase transition easily. Metropolis Monte Carlo method was chosen to sample the configuration space for structural optimization, and for simulating thermal equilibrium in a small Lennard-Jones cluster. Simulated Annealing technique stands as one of the most general and efficient ways of addressing the global optimization problem. Simulated annealing essentially consists of cooling slowly. The initial temperature, cooling schedule and total simulation length are the few but important parameters of a simulated annealing optimization. Starting from a random atomic configuration, the MC simulation is carried out following the metropolis acceptance rule, and after some number of steps the temperature was decreased. In this way, the most stable configuration of a 13 atom cluster was found by energy minimization.\n","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"3a95e485dcd8398b72302153ee789a4c","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/04_monte_carlo/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/04_monte_carlo/","section":"project","summary":"Simulated Annealing Of A Finite System","tags":["monte"],"title":"Monte Carlo Simulations","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
