Nonetheless, the poor glass-forming ability (GFA) and strong crystallization tendency have hindered their utilization in various technological applications.

The structural characterization using Raman, 27Al MAS-NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations reveal that, Zn2+ ions adopt tetrahedral coordination and contribute as network formers along with Al3+ ions. Notably, MD simulations indicate a preference of ZnO4 units for the CaO6 sites to convert non-bridging oxygens to bridging oxygens. The decrease in glass transition temperature and the increase in elastic modulus is noticed which correlated with the structural changes in the studied glasses.

Experimentally probing their structural evolution during transitions involving amorphous phases is a significant challenge, especially at the medium-range length scale. To overcome this challenge, here we first train a deep learning-based force field to identify the structural characteristics of both crystalline and non-crystalline ZIF phases. This allows us to reproduce the structural evolution trend during the melting of crystals and formation of ZIF glasses at various length scales with an accuracy comparable to that of ab initio molecular dynamics, yet at a much lower computational cost. Based on this approach, we propose a new structural descriptor, namely, the ring orientation index, to capture the propensity for crystallization of ZIF-4 (Zn(Im)2, Im = C3H3N2−) glasses, as well as for the formation of ZIF-zni (Zn(Im)2) out of the high-density amorphous phase. This crystal formation process is a result of the reorientation of imidazole rings by sacrificing the order of the structure around the zinc-centered tetrahedra. The outcomes of this work are useful for studying phase transitions in other metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and may thus guide the development of MOF glasses.","tags":null,"title":"Deciphering the controlling factors for phase transitions in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gangareddy Jagannath","Rudra Pratyasha","Chirumamilla Manohar","Dr. Sudheer Ganisetti","Kasimuthumaniyan Subramanian","Sahoo Sourav","Jayanthi K.","Rathod Jagannath","Soma Venugopal Rao","Das Subrata","Gosvami Nitya Nand","Krishnan N.

Often, they are regarded as isotropic materials; however, structural anisotropy can be induced through processing in mechanical fields and leads to unique materials properties. Unfortunately, due to the lack of local, atomic-scale analysis methods, the microscopic mechanisms leading to anisotropy remained elusive. Using novel analysis methods on glasses generated by molecular dynamics simulations, this paper provides a microscopic understanding of topological anisotropy in silica (SiO2) glass under mechanical loads. The anisotropy observed in silica glass originates from a preferred orientation of SiO4 tetrahedra at both short- and medium-range levels that can be controlled via the mode of mechanical loading. The findings elucidate the relation between the deformation protocol and the resulting anisotropic structure of the silica network (involving both persistent and transient effects), and thus provide important insight for the design of oxide glasses with tailored materials properties.","tags":null,"title":"The origin of deformation induced topological anisotropy in silica glass","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shweta R.

However, they still suffer from poor ionic conductivity and crack-resistance, which need to be improved for better battery performance, reliability, and service life. The current study shows a significant enhancement in crack resistance (from 11.3 N to 32.9 N) for Na3Al1.8Si1.65P1.8O12 glass (Ag-0 glass) upon Na+-Ag+ ion-exchange (IE) due to compressive stresses generated in the glass surface while the ionic conductivity values (∼10−5 S/cm at 473 K) were retained. In this study, magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, Vickers micro hardness, and impedance spectroscopic techniques were used to evaluate the intermediate-range structure, atomic structure, crack resistance and conductivity of the glass. MAS-NMR and MD simulations confirm the presence of Si‒O‒Al‒O‒P groups in the glass, thus enabling formation of Na percolated channel regions. AC-conductivity analysis for Ag-0 and ion-exchanged Ag-0 glass suggests that the mobility of Na+ ion increases with increasing temperature. It is observed that the measured mean square displacement (〈R2(tp)〉) for sodium cations using AC-conductivity isotherms is nearly constant up to 448 K and then increases with increasing temperature up to 523 K. From the impedance spectra for ion-exchanged Ag-0 glass, it is identified that the increase in 〈R2(tp)〉 and thereby, the mobility of sodium-ions for Ag-0 glass is due to the structural variations in the Ag-0 glass with increasing the temperature.

As a network modifier, Na+ cations modify the structural distributions and create nonbridging oxygens. As a charge compensator, Na+ cations provide imbalanced charge for oxygen that is linked between two network-forming tetrahedra. However, the factors controlling the mobility of Na+ ions in glasses, which in turn affects the ionic conductivity, remain unclear. In the current work, using high-fidelity experiments and atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that the ionic conductivity of the Na3Al2P3O12 (Si0) glass material is dependent not only on the concentration of Na+ charge carriers but also on the number of charge-compensated oxygens within its first coordination sphere. To investigate, we chose a series of glasses formulated by the substitution of Si for P in Si0 glass based on the hypothesis that Si substitution in the presence of Na+ cations increases the number of Si–O–Al bonds, which enhances the role of Na as a charge compensator. The structural and conductivity properties of bulk glass materials are evaluated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. We observe that the increasing number of charge-imbalanced bridging oxygens (BOs) with the substitution of Si for P in Si0 glass enhances the ionic conductivity by an order of magnitude—from 3.7 × 10–8 S.cm–1 to 3.3 × 10–7 S.cm–1 at 100 °C. By rigorously quantifying the channel regions in the glass structure, using MD simulations, we demonstrate that the enhanced ionic conductivity can be attributed to the increased connectivity of Na-rich channels because of the increased charge-compensated BOs around the Na atoms. Overall, this study provides new insights for designing next-generation glass-based electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity for Na-ion batteries.","tags":null,"title":"Ionic Conductivity of NASICON based Na3Al2P3O12 Glass Electrolytes − Role of Charge Compensators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anuraag Gaddam","Amarnath Allu","Dr. Sudheer Ganisetti","Hugo Fernandes","George Stan","Catalin Negrila","Atul Jamale","Francois Mear","Lionel Montagne","and José Ferreira"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1627257600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627257600,"objectID":"9efd67b491806446148ab34370fdc254","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/publication/publication_04/","publishdate":"2021-07-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publication_04/","section":"publication","summary":"The commercially ubiquitous liquid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries have several shortcomings in terms of safety. Therefore, development of solid electrolytes, especially those that are glass-based, has been gaining increasing interest in recent times. However, the fundamental understanding of the changes in the glass structure and the corresponding changes in the properties due to the addition of dopants is necessary for the development of glasses. Therefore, here, we report a study on the role of vanadium on the glass structure, ionic conduction, crystallization behavior, and other properties of lithium silicate-based glasses (23Li2O–2.64K2O–2.64Al2O3–71.72SiO2) as a solid electrolyte for high-temperature Li-ion battery applications. Furthermore, we proposed a mathematical model to describe/quantify the ion-conducting channels’ connectivity in glasses. The experimental glass structures were assessed using 29Si, 51V, 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared, and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy techniques. The ionic conductivity was measured by impedance spectroscopy, and the crystallization behavior was studied by optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were also used to gain structural insights of the glasses. In the designed compositions, the addition of vanadium decreased the overall concentration of Li+ ions. However, the results revealed that the ionic conductivity improved with the addition of vanadium in spite of a decrease in the number of charge carriers. This suggests that vanadium makes the pathways easier for the conducting ions. Thus, we conclude that vanadium modifies the conduction channels to promote better hoping of the ions from one site to another.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of Vanadium Oxide on the Structure and Li-Ion Conductivity of Lithium Silicate Glasses","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622246400,"objectID":"dec257ec29b834d8e7f478fbb64eb73e","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/05_heart_disease/","publishdate":"2021-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/05_heart_disease/","section":"project","summary":"Identification of heart disease - Supervised Learning","tags":["machine"],"title":"Machine Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621814400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621814400,"objectID":"8c07dfe9b733332dc5c685b567d308f2","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/accomplishments/16_udemy_sql_bootcamp/","publishdate":"2021-05-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/accomplishments/16_udemy_sql_bootcamp/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"","tags":["sql","bootcamps"],"title":"The Complete SQL Bootcamp 2021","type":"accomplishments"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621728000,"objectID":"eaebd4290cb565e2354f2e1c6f24ffd9","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/accomplishments/15_udemy_data_science_bootcamp/","publishdate":"2021-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/accomplishments/15_udemy_data_science_bootcamp/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"","tags":["python","data analysis","data engineering","data science","machine learning","bootcamps","deep learning"],"title":"Complete Machine Learning \u0026 Data Science Bootcamp 2021","type":"accomplishments"},{"authors":["Sakthi Prasad","Dr. Sudheer Ganisetti","Anuradha Jana","Shashi Kant","P.K.

The role of the incorporated fluoride and its distribution within the glass were interpreted and analyzed using Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results were compared with the modified random network (MRN) model. The interpretations from the model have been verified using the MAS-NMR spectroscopy technique. According to this model, fluoride containing bioactive glasses have been proposed to consist of silicate rich network regions and modifier cation – fluoride rich inter-network regions. The interface region was found to consist of non-bridging oxygen species (NBO) and phosphate cations which are either isolated orthophosphates (Q0P) or bridged with silicates in the form of pyrophosphate (Q1P) units forming Si–O–P bonds. The gradual substitution of CaF2 for CaO in the base glass resulted in an increase in the silicate network connectivity with a reduction in the NBOs and lead to an increase in the association of modifier cations with fluoride ions. However, fluoride ions were found to show a marginal preference to associate with Na+ cations leading to a decrease in the association of Na+ ions with orthophosphate and silicate units. These overall structural findings were correlated with the in vitro ion dissolution behaviour of the bioactive glasses as well as with the thermal properties. The glasses were tested for their in vitro cell viability towards mouse osteoblast type (MC3T3) cells in which fluoride containing bioactive glasses did not show any toxicity and exhibited better cell proliferation.

Analyses in the short-range order confirm that silicon and the majority of aluminium cations form regular tetrahedra. Well-separated homonuclear (Si–O–Si) and heteronuclear (Si–O–Al) cluster regions have been identified. In addition, a channel region (C-Region), separated from the network region, enriched with both NBO and non-framework modifier cations, has also been identified. These findings are in support of the previously proposed extended modified random network (EMRN) model for aluminosilicate glasses. A detailed analysis of the structural distributions revealed that a majority of Al, 51.6%, is found in Si–O–Al links. Although the formation of Al–O–Al and Al–NBO bonds is energetically less favourable, a significant amount of Al is found in Al–O–Al links (33.5%), violating Lowenstein's rule, and the remainder is bonded with non-bridging oxygen (NBO) in the form of Al–NBO (Al–O–(Ca, Mg)). The conditions necessary for the formation of less favourable bonds are attributed to the presence of a high amount of modifier cations in current CMAS glass and their preferable coordination.","tags":null,"title":"Elucidating the formation of Al–NBO bonds, Al–O–Al linkages and clusters in alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glasses based on molecular dynamics simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amarnath R.

The current paper shows that breaching of the Al-avoidance principle is essential for understanding the distribution of network-forming AlO4 and SiO4 structural units in alkaline-earth aluminosilicate glasses. The present study proposes a new modified random network (NMRN) model, which accepts Al–O–Al linkages for aluminosilicate glasses. The NMRN model consists of two regions, a network structure region (NS-Region) composed of well-separated homonuclear and heteronuclear framework species and a channel region (C-Region) of nonbridging oxygens (NBOs) and nonframework cations. The NMRN model accounts for the structural changes and devitrification behavior of aluminosilicate glasses. A parent Ca- and Al-rich melilite-based CaO–MgO–Al2O3–SiO2 (CMAS) glass composition was modified by substituting MgO for CaO and SiO2 for Al2O3 to understand variations in the distribution of network-forming structural units in the NS-region and devitrification behavior upon heat treating. The structural features of the glass and glass–ceramics (GCs) were meticulously assessed by advanced characterization techniques including neutron diffraction (ND), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), 29Si and 27Al magic angle spinning (MAS)-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and in situ Raman spectroscopy. ND revealed the formation of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedral units in all the glass compositions. Simulations of chemical glass compositions based on deconvolution of 29Si MAS NMR spectral analysis indicate the preferred formation of Si–O–Al over Si–O–Si and Al–O–Al linkages and the presence of a high concentration of nonbridging oxygens leading to the formation of a separate NS-region containing both SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra (Si/Al) (heteronuclear) in addition to the presence of Al[4]–O–Al[4] bonds; this region coexists with a predominantly SiO4-containing (homonuclear) NS-region. In GCs, obtained after heat treatment at 850 °C for 250 h, the formation of crystalline phases, as revealed from Rietveld refinement of XRD data, may be understood on the basis of the distribution of SiO4 and AlO4 structural units in the NS-region. The in situ Raman spectra of the GCs confirmed the formation of a Si/Al structural region, as well as indicating interaction between the Al/Si region and SiO4-rich region at higher temperatures, leading to the formation of additional crystalline phases.","tags":null,"title":"Structure and Crystallization of Alkaline-Earth Aluminosilicate Glasses: Prevention of the Alumina-Avoidance Principle","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Multiscale Modelling of the Influence of Oxygen on Structure and Cohesion of \u0026Sigma;5 Symmetrical Tilt Grain Boundary in Molybdenum The brittle fracture of real materials originates from the atomistic mechanisms like sequential bond breaking, which leads to the crack initiation, propagation and finally to material damage in the macro scale. Predicting such material failures, and there by analyzing mechanical properties are challenging as well as complex tasks. To achieve these challenges, it often require the knowledge from atomic level to macroscopic level, therefore, scale bridging of different length scales is necessary. In this work, we have investigated how the oxygen and carbon impurities influence fracture behavior when segregated to the ∑5 symmetrical tilt grain boundary in molybdenum. Mechanical properties such as work of separation and theoretical strength were computed based on the calculations performed at different length scales, i.e, from atomistic length scales to macroscopic length scales. Ab-initio method based on density functional theory were used for the atomistic scale calculations, and finite element method based on cohesive traction separation laws were used for the continuum scale calculations.\nThe key idea to this approach is the recasting of the atomistic results within the frame work of a continuum cohesive zone model. The traction separation laws were derived by performing the tensile tests using the first principle calculations. The effective cohesive zone elements were then defined, and placed along all the possible fracture interfaces in a finite element mesh. Finite element simulations were then used to study the failure properties at the macroscopic length scales.\nDensity functional theory based total energy and electronic structure calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The electron exchange and correlation interactions were approximated by the generalized gradient approximation, and electron ion interactions were treated with the ultrasoft pseudo potentials for 80 atom supercell. The grain boundary energy, work of separation, and theoretical strengths were calculated for various oxygen impurity concentrations, i.e, from 0 to 4 oxygen atoms per grain boundary. It was found that oxygen shows an embrittling effect in the molybdenum grain boundary, see the above figure. However, when carbon is placed along with oxygen, the embrittling effect of the oxygen was compensated partially by the carbon atoms.\n","date":1343779200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343779200,"objectID":"e0dc35ff4d12009163c3d86bf6a461d5","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/01_multiscale_modelling/","publishdate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/01_multiscale_modelling/","section":"project","summary":"Multiscale Modelling of the influence of Oxygen ...","tags":["dft","fem"],"title":"Multiscale Modelling","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Building of Bridges using Phase Field Method In civil engineering, shape optimization is necessary to build strong structures according to their structural performances. Most structural optimizations take into account structural performances such as stress, mass, deformation. In this work, we have partially optimized the shape of a bridge which connects two banks of a river. To build the strong bridge to withstand high mechanical loads, we have used the technique of growing high strength material in the place of high stress areas, and filled the remaining place with a soft and low weight material such as ‘air’. The ‘growth’ of the high strength material in high stress fields has done based on the Phase Field method. The key idea used is the replacement of actual shape optimization problem by a two phase material distribution problem. The two materials used are the high contrast in their strength properties, a matrix material and a high strength material in the form of inclusions. Phase field method was used to find the motion of optimized shape boundaries. To solve the multicomponent phase field equations, an open source library called ‘OpenPhase’ developed at Prof. Ingo Steinbach department, ICAMS, has been used. The above figure shows: (a) Initialization of different areas of a bridge with different phases, (b) A partially optimized arc shape of the bridge (every pole has the same eigenstrain)\nA C++ code has been written to initialize the model with different phases representing different material properties in the OpenPhase source code. The driving force is assigned to the inclusion material in such a way that it grows in the region where the stresses are high. From the results, we observed that the shape of the optimized structure looks like a semicircle arc shape. Here, we have not taken the idle values of the input parameters for the surrounding environments like water and air etc., so the arc shape is not fully formed. Some more work has to be done to complete the arc shape bridge. However, based on the primary results, we have showcased that the structures can be optimized with Phase Fields using the OpenPhase code.\n","date":1333238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1333238400,"objectID":"313f991281e4e918f3a064d2282f5fe6","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/02_phase_field/","publishdate":"2012-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/02_phase_field/","section":"project","summary":"Building of Bridges using Phase Field Method","tags":["phase"],"title":"Phase Field","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Diffusion of Carbon in High Silicon Steel Many important phenomena in materials science involve diffusion of impurities. It is well known that diffusion of carbon in metals typically occurs via an interstitial mechanism, which can be strongly affected by the presence of other alloying elements. The interstitial diffusion of carbon controls the phase transformation in steel and therefore the resulting microstructure and mechanical properties. Density functional theory (DFT) based total energy and electronic structure calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) to understand how silicon affects the the diffusion path of carbon in steel. The electron exchange and correlation interactions were approximated by the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), and electron ion interactions were treated with Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) potentials. Through this work, we have studied two cases. In the first case, the energy barriers of one octahedral site to another octahedral site in the diffusion path of carbon atom away from the silicon atom in bcc Fe were computed, and these values were compared with the energy barriers of the pure bcc Fe system. In the second case, we have studied the possibilities of diffusion paths of C from octahedral position of one of the faces of a unit cell to the octahedral site of the neighboring face of the same unit cell. Fig (a) shows a supercell consisting of two unit cells. Silicon is substitutionally added to the body centred atom of the first unitcell, and carbon diffuses away from the silicon atom through interstitial positions 1_Oct, 2_Tetra, 3_Oc, etc., as shown in the fig (a). The fig (b) shows the total relaxed energy of the system of 53 Fe atoms with one substitutionally added Si and one interstitial C atom along the diffusing path of C from 1st octahedral site to the 7th Octahedral site away from the Si. After finding the formation energies and energy barriers, we conclude that the silicon traps the carbon atom to its second nearest neighbor tetrahedral position or third nearest neighbor octahedral position. It was also revealed that the diffusion path of C from Octahedral site of one face to the octahedral site of the neighboring face is possible only through the tetrahedral interstitial site even in the presence of Si.\n","date":1305417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1305417600,"objectID":"9f9a9d5991dee0638f4d22c22e3c356d","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/03_diffusion_of_carbon/","publishdate":"2011-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/03_diffusion_of_carbon/","section":"project","summary":"Diffusion of Carbon in High Silicon Steel","tags":["dft"],"title":"DFT","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Monte Carlo method was used to tackle the global optimization problem of molecular structure. A Fortran code was developed to optimize a 13 atom molecular structure. Molecular simulations are very convenient to get insight into the structure and thermal behavior of small atomic clusters. Atomic structures are finite size aggregates containing between a few and millions of particles. Due to their small dimensions, their theoretical study faces serious difficulties. The most properties exhibit a strong dependence on the number of atoms. These difficulties actually begin with the unoptimized structure, from which other characteristics will develop. Predicting the temperature where the cluster changes phase also requires simulations. By the use of numerical simulation method, we can achieve phase transition easily. Metropolis Monte Carlo method was chosen to sample the configuration space for structural optimization, and for simulating thermal equilibrium in a small Lennard-Jones cluster. Simulated Annealing technique stands as one of the most general and efficient ways of addressing the global optimization problem. Simulated annealing essentially consists of cooling slowly. The initial temperature, cooling schedule and total simulation length are the few but important parameters of a simulated annealing optimization. Starting from a random atomic configuration, the MC simulation is carried out following the metropolis acceptance rule, and after some number of steps the temperature was decreased. In this way, the most stable configuration of a 13 atom cluster was found by energy minimization.\n","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"3a95e485dcd8398b72302153ee789a4c","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/project/04_monte_carlo/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/04_monte_carlo/","section":"project","summary":"Simulated Annealing Of A Finite System","tags":["monte"],"title":"Monte Carlo Simulations","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://sudheerganisetti.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
