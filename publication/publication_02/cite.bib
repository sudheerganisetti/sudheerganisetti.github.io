abstract  ="Exploring the reasons for the initiation of Al–O–Al bond formation in alkali-earth alumino silicate glasses is a key topic in the glass-science community. Evidence for the formation of Al–O–Al and Al–NBO bonds in the glass composition 38.7CaO–9.7MgO–12.9Al2O3–38.7SiO2 (CMAS{,} mol%) has been provided based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Analyses in the short-range order confirm that silicon and the majority of aluminium cations form regular tetrahedra. Well-separated homonuclear (Si–O–Si) and heteronuclear (Si–O–Al) cluster regions have been identified. In addition{,} a channel region (C-Region){,} separated from the network region{,} enriched with both NBO and non-framework modifier cations{,} has also been identified. These findings are in support of the previously proposed extended modified random network (EMRN) model for aluminosilicate glasses. A detailed analysis of the structural distributions revealed that a majority of Al{,} 51.6%{,} is found in Si–O–Al links. Although the formation of Al–O–Al and Al–NBO bonds is energetically less favourable{,} a significant amount of Al is found in Al–O–Al links (33.5%){,} violating Lowenstein{'}s rule{,} and the remainder is bonded with non-bridging oxygen (NBO) in the form of Al–NBO (Al–O–(Ca{,} Mg)). The conditions necessary for the formation of less favourable bonds are attributed to the presence of a high amount of modifier cations in current CMAS glass and their preferable coordination."}
