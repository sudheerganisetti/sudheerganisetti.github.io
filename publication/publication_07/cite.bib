abstract = {Oxide glasses with a network structure are omnipresent in daily life. Often, they are regarded as isotropic materials; however, structural anisotropy can be induced through processing in mechanical fields and leads to unique materials properties. Unfortunately, due to the lack of local, atomic-scale analysis methods, the microscopic mechanisms leading to anisotropy remained elusive. Using novel analysis methods on glasses generated by molecular dynamics simulations, this paper provides a microscopic understanding of topological anisotropy in silica (SiO2) glass under mechanical loads. The anisotropy observed in silica glass originates from a preferred orientation of SiO4 tetrahedra at both short- and medium-range levels that can be controlled via the mode of mechanical loading. The findings elucidate the relation between the deformation protocol and the resulting anisotropic structure of the silica network (involving both persistent and transient effects), and thus provide important insight for the design of oxide glasses with tailored materials properties.}
